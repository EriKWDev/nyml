Nyml is a simple YAML-1.0-like implementation for Nim language. Fast and Easy, **Nyml has no serialization, tags, indicators or any weird things.** In fact, Nyml is between `toml` and `yaml`, Providing support for dumping and parsing human-readable contents from `NYMl` to `JSON` and back.

_If you need a YAML 1.2 compatible library go with [flyx's NimYAML](https://github.com/flyx/NimYAML)._

Nyml is highly recommended for holding static configuration files, providing `get`, `add`, `update`, `delete` procs with or without `dot annotation access` for `JSON` nodes.

Also included: 
- `boolean` formatter (`no`, `yes`, `true`, `false`, lowercase and uppercase)
- `integer`
- `string` (single/double quotes)
- `array` (inline or list)
- `object` trees
- `comments`

# Usage
```python
import nyml

let grocery_list = """
user:
    id: 12345
    name: "jenna.jay"

cart:
    - apples
    - avocado
    - pineapple
    - cabbage
    - brocolli
    - carrots
    - spinach
"""

let collection = Nyml(engine: Y2J).parse(grocery_list)

```

Examples using `dot annotation access`.
